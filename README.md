The functionalities are:
1.	Upon selection the right option ✅, the color of the option changes to Green 🟢.
2.	Upon selection the wrong option ❌, the color of the option changes to Red 🔴 and the right one is visible with Green background color 🟢.
3.	Upon selection options the options gets disabled, so that multiple options are not being selected (see the demo video), and the cursor changes to no-drop 🚫.
4.	The Skip Button is to skip the current question.
5.	The Restart Button is to restart the Quiz Game again.
6.	Apart from that hover effect, box shadow, and transition properties are used to beautify the UI.
